Description
===========
sonar2xbee is a program written for the Arduino Leonardo, to allow it to accept PWM input from a LV-MaxSonar-EZ4 and send it to the pin-serial interface on the board. It is intended for use with an XBee module, to ultimately send the information wirelessly to a another device. This program is intended for use with [Ino](http://inotool.org/).

Future Work
===========
This is intended to be expanded to accommodate multiple sonars, and ultimately to be interfaced as a [ROS](http://ros.org/) node. I also intend to move it to a smaller board (maybe an Arduino Pro Mini). Diagrams will be up soon.
